# Partisan-Confidence-Model
Simulation files for the *Partisan Confidence* model of opinion evolution written in python programming language. 
The Project include three folders as below: 
1. Corollaries: A jupyter notebook for verifying collaries. 
2. One-dimensional: Two jupyter notebooks for simulating the Partisan confidenc-lite (PC-lite) and Partisan confidence (PC) model 
3. Two-dimensional: Two jupyter notebooks for simulating the Partisan confidenc-lite multi-dimensional (MDPC-lite) and Partisan confidenc multi-dimensional (MDPC) model 

## One-dimensional model
